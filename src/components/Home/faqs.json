      "question": "What is OpenRefinery.AI this application about?",
      "answer": "Today's AI chatbots struggle with subtle language differences. OpenRefinery.AI collects contributions from individuals to train the AI to learn different languages and cultures. Identical to how miners excavate and refine raw minerals into dazzling gemstones, OpenRefinery.AI aims to generate top-notch data that you can use to train your AI-powered chatbots. Users can take on multiple roles when onboarding this platform: Creators (create projects and tasks), Miners (generate and submit paraphrases) and Inspectors (review and validate submissions)"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I come onboard this application?",
      "answer": "You may sign in using your internet identity. To get started, you are only required to create a username and upload a profile picture."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get paid?",
      "answer": "Paraphrases that are submitted by Miners are first validated by Inspectors. If a submission is eventually approved (based on consensus mechanism), then the corresponding Miner and Inspector will be paid out the stipulated reward amount in GEMs. The GEMs accumulated can be exchanged for money, which will be directly transferred to their virtual wallets (linked during sign up)."
    }
  ],
  "Miners": [
    {
      "question": "[Miner] Is there a limit to how many entries I can submit per day?",
      "answer": "There are no restrictions to the number of projects that Miners can join. However, to maintain the quality and standards of paraphrases submitted, a limitation of 50 submissions per day will be imposed by the system."
    },
    {
      "question": "[Miner] What if somebody else has already submitted an identical paraphrase?",
      "answer": "You will receive a system notification if your paraphrase has already been submitted before. Rewards are only granted for new, unique submissions."
    },
    {
      "question": "[Miner] Are there different amounts of rewards for different language translations?",
      "answer": "Reward amounts differ from project to project. Kindly refer to the project details for more information."
    }
  ],
  "Inspectors": [
    {
      "question": "[Inspector] Who is an Inspector? What is the criteria to becoming one?",
      "answer": "Inspectors will evaluate the paraphrases submitted by their peer Miners and either approve or disapprove the submissions based on the validation criteria. Default Inspectors for the platform are the System Administrators. Miners can eventually qualify as an Inspector after completing a minimum of 100 jobs and obtaining a validation score of at least 85%."
    },
    {
      "question": "[Inspector] What is the consensus system?",
      "answer": "All paraphrases will need to undergo validation check before being approved. This validation check is done by fellow users or system administrators (Inspectors). Inspectors vote to approve or disapprove a paraphrase based on set criteria. If over 80% of Inspectors approve, both the submitting Miner and Inspectors are rewarded. Conversely, if over 80% disapprove, the Miner isn't paid, but Inspectors are rewarded. If no consensus is reached, the paraphrase is rejected, and no payments are made."
    },
    {
      "question": "[Inspector] What is the penalty system?",
      "answer": "When validating a paraphrase, Inspectors who fall within the <= 20% of unpopular votes, will be penalised for having made an incorrect decision. They will not be paid for that job, and to further discourage such mistakes, will be banned by the system from working any jobs for a week."
    }
  ],
  "Creators": [
    {
      "question": "[Creator] How does the validation system work? How can I be assured of the relevancy and appropriateness of the paraphrases?",
      "answer": "The system uses consensus mechanism to validate paraphrases. Creators can choose how many validators will be reviewing each submitted paraphrase. Minimally 80% of Inspectors must opt for the same, unanimous decision - this determines whether a paraphrase is approved or rejected."
    },
    {
      "question": "[Creator] What are the advantages of opting for this system?",
      "answer": "Transactions are transparent when done via OpenRefinery.AI system. Creators can tell exactly how many people have contributed to each set of paraphrases. In the future, Creators will also be able to curate datasets based on the demographic of users (age, gender and more)."
    },
    {
      "question": "[Creator] How much does it cost to use this service?",
      "answer": "Creators have complete control over the settings for each project and the payouts for each task. Here is a typical example of a project created: 50 subjects requiring 100 utterances each in German. (one language only) Payout for each successfully submitted and approved utterance - 10 GEMs 50 validations required per utterance. Payout for each successful validation: 1 GEM 10,000 jobs created in all which costs 55,000 GEMs. Conversion rate: 1 GEM = 0.05 SGD Total cost of project: $2,750"
