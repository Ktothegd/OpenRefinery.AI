## Background

In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving landscape, artificial intelligence (A) has become an integral component across diverse industries, ranging from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. However, the efficacy of AI models hinges largely on the quality of their training datasets. A good training dataset will ensure that the model can produce accurate, reliable results, without being compromised by any form of AI bias. It is no wonder that there is a huge demand for the training dataset market, which is projected to grow at 24.16% annually. 

In the realm of chatbots, the significance of training datasets are particularly paramount. Chatbots are instrumental in providing personalised interactions, which enhances customer engagement, retention and ultimately, sales. Additionally, by offering 24/7 support and minimising manpower costs, chatbots present a cost-effective solution for businesses across industries. With over 62% of consumers preferring interacting with chatbots over human agents, and consumer spending via chatbots projected to soar to USD 142 billion by 2024 (particularly in the retail industry), the importance of training AI algorithms for chatbot applications simply cannot be overstated. 

Whilst there are existing solutions (MTurk, CrowdFlower, Clickworker, etc), they are hampered by transparency issues, quality control concerns, lack of decentralisation and multilingual support challenges. 

Hence, there remains an urgent need to create a data acquisition platform that can empower businesses to train chatbot AI effectively, while ensuring the quality and integrity of their datasets.
